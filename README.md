Orientation Lot Tracking Exercise - Jordan Chow

Setup:

In the terminal, navigate into:

~LotTrackingSystem/API (replace ~ with the correct file path)
enter "dotnet ef database update" (this will create the database)

~LotTrackingSystem/API (replace ~ with the correct file path)
enter "dotnet run"

~LotTrackingSystem/client (replace ~ with the correct file path)
enter "ng serve"

If the database creation has not worked, you can use the "SQLQuery.sql" in the LotTrackingSystem, with a SQL editor
and follow the instructions there. This is to create the database locally through SQL.

After the above steps have been completed, open the website at: https://localhost:4200/
